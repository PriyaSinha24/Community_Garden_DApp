# Community Garden DApp

## Project Description

The Community Garden DApp is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that enables communities to share garden plots and exchange gardening knowledge. This platform democratizes access to gardening spaces while fostering a collaborative environment where community members can learn from each other's experiences and expertise.

The DApp allows users to create, rent, and manage garden plots while participating in a knowledge-sharing ecosystem where gardening tips, techniques, and experiences are exchanged freely among community members.
